/**
 Case 1:  Local user initiates the close

   In this case, a FIN segment can be constructed and placed on the
   outgoing segment queue.  No further SENDs from the user will be
   accepted by the TCP, and it enters the FIN-WAIT-1 state.  RECEIVEs
   are allowed in this state.  All segments preceding and including FIN
   will be retransmitted until acknowledged.  When the other TCP has
   both acknowledged the FIN and sent a FIN of its own, the first TCP
   can ACK this FIN.  Note that a TCP receiving a FIN will ACK but not
   send its own FIN until its user has CLOSED the connection also.
